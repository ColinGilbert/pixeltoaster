PixelToaster is a library for C++ programmers who want to write their own software rendering routines, reading and writing to an array of pixels.

You choose between high dynamic range floating point color or 32 bit truecolor and pixeltoaster converts to the native display format automatically. You also get basic keyboard and mouse input and a high resolution timer.

PixelToaster is designed by Glenn Fiedler, author of the PTC, OpenPTC and TinyPTC libraries.
