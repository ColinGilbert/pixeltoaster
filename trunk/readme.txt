13th Jan 2007:

latest pixeltoaster source code is broken!

i'm working on cleaning up the source tree to make everything a lot simpler:

 	PixelToaster.cpp
	PixelToaster.h
	PixelToasterConversion.h
	PixelToasterWindows.h
	PixelToasterUnix.h
	PixelToasterApple.h

instead of the whole set of headers that currently live under source/*

this is a work in progress and i should be finished in a few days,

until then, use the last known good release, or sync to date january 12th 2007

cheers
