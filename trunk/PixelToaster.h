	/** \brief Represents a pixel in floating point color mode.

		Each pixel is made up of three components: red, green and blue.
	
		In floating point color each component is represented by a floating point value.
		0.0 is minimum intensity and 1.0 is maximum intensity.
	
		Some examples:
		
			- black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
			- white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
			- grey (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
			- red (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
			- purple (1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
			- green (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
		
		Any component less than zero is treated as black, and any value greater than 1.0
		is treated as full intensity. You do not need to clamp the component values manually!
	
		You can acheive special effects by exploiting the so called "high dynamic range" available in
		floating point color. See http://www.debevec.org for information on this technique.
	
		Also, please note that each floating point pixel contains an alpha value
		which you are free to use however you like. For example, it could be used as a z-buffer 
		for a software renderer, or simply as 4 bytes of storage per pixel for any purpose. 
	
		If you dont have any use for the alpha value, its safe to just ignore it. 

		\note You can refer to this class simply as "Pixel" if you like because floating point color 
		      is the default in Pixel Toaster. See the floating point example source code for details.

		Each pixel consists of three 8 bit color values packed into a 32 bit integer.

		The color components are stored in the integer in rgb order. The high 8 bits are referred to as 'alpha' but are not used.
	
		Here are some examples:
		
			- black = 0x00000000
			- white = 0x00FFFFFF
			- grey = 0x007F7F7F
			- red = 0x00FF0000
			- purple = 0x00FF00FF
			- green = 0x0000FF00

		Obviously it can get quite tedious manipulating the integer directly, so this union gives you 
		the option of directly accessing the integer, or manipulating each of the 8 bit component values
		directly:

		%TrueColorPixel pixel;<br>
		pixel.r = 0;<br>
		pixel.g = 255;<br>
		pixel.b = 0;<br>

		And voila, you have a green pixel. Beware though that unlike floating point color,
		truecolor does not clamp the components for you. You need to ensure that your values
		stay within the [0,255] range or they will wrap around and the pixel color will not
		be what you intended.

		\note The top 8 bits of the integer are unused and are referred to as 'alpha'. 
		      You can use these bits for 8 bits of per-pixel storage, or ignore them completely,
		      they have absolutely no effect on the pixel color.

    /** \brief Lets you chose between fullscreen and windowed when opening a display.

		Display output can be either "windowed" or "fullscreen". Windowed output opens a display window on the desktop
		and draws your pixels inside this window. Fullscreen output switches to the best display mode mode and fills the 
		entire screen with your pixels.
		
		An additional "default" output type is used to indicate that you want to open a display and use the 'best'
		output mode for the current platform. This is a rather nebulous concept. Currently the default output mode just 
		maps to windowed mode, but this may change in the future. The bottom line is that if you absolutely require
		fullscreen or windowed output, you should specify this, or the display will just do whatever it thinks is best.

		Here is some example code to demonstrate output use:

		\code

Output output = Output::Fullscreen;

if ( output != Output::Windowed )
{
	output = Output::Windowed;
}

    /** \brief Provides the mechanism for getting your pixels up on the screen.

		Every Pixel Toaster application needs a display. Lets analyze a simple application to understand exactly what is going on:

		\code

Display display( "Example", 320, 240 );

vector<Pixel> pixels( 320 * 240 );

while ( display.open() )
{
	display.update( pixels );
}

		\endcode

		In a nutshell, the simple application does the following:

			- Create and open a display
			- Create an array of pixels to work with
			- Loop and update the pixels to the display

		All you need to do is implement your rendering code and do it each frame before you update the display. 
		Each time display update is called the array of pixels are copied to the display, so you can see them!

		Now lets actually draw something. Here is the same code again, but this time each update we set a random pixel to the color blue:

		\code

const int width = 320;
const int height = 240;

Display display( "Example", width, height );

vector<Pixel> pixels( width, height );

while ( display.open() )
{
	const int x = rand() % width;
	const int y = rand() % height;

	pixels[x+y*width].b = 1.0f;

	display.update( pixels );
}
		\endcode

    /** \brief A high resolution timer.

		The most common use for a timer is to keep track of the current time, and the delta time
		each frame you render to the display. This lets you make sure your program is framerate independent,
		in other words, it runs at the same speed no matter the framerate.

		Here is a simple example:

		\code

		Display display( "timer example", 320, 240 );

		Timer timer;

		while ( display.open() )
		{
			const double time = timer.time();
			const double delta = timer.delta();

			// advance animation forward by delta seconds...
		}

		\endcode

		\note The timer uses doubles instead of floats to ensure maximum precision is available.

    /** \brief Implement the listener interface and register with a display to receive events.
		
		This interface defines all the callback functions for display events.
		It gives you keyboard and mouse input, plus useful system events for window activation
		and close window requests.

		Use of the listener interface is optional. If you do not register a display listener,
		your program will respond to input in using the following default behavior:

			- Pressing the escape key closes the display.
			- If the user presses the platform close window key combinaton (Alt-F4 on windows, Apple-W on Mac) or clicks on the close icon in the title bar then the display is closed.
			- All other events are ignored.

		This avoids writing code to handle basic events when all you want is to open a display and draw pixels.

		But when you do want to listen to input, just implement this interface in your own class,
		and register your listener with the display using Display::listener.
		
		Here is a quick example to demonstrate:

		\code

class Application : public Listener
{
public:

	Application()
	{
		quit = false;
	}

    int run()
    {
		// open display

        const int width = 320;
        const int height = 240;

        if ( !display.open( "Listener Example", width, height ) )
			return 1;

		// register listener

        display.listener( this );

		// keep updating the display until we are ready to quit

        vector<Pixel> pixels( width * height );

        while ( !quit )
        {
			// ...

            display.update( pixels );
        }
    }

protected:

    void onKeyDown( DisplayInterface & display, Key key )
    {
        if ( key==Key::Escape )
            quit = true;

		return false;		// disable default key handlers
    }

    void onKeyPressed( DisplayInterface & display, Key key )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onKeyUp( DisplayInterface & display, Key key )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onMouseButtonDown( DisplayInterface & display, Mouse mouse )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onMouseButtonUp( DisplayInterface & display, Mouse mouse )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onMouseMove( DisplayInterface & display, Mouse mouse )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onActivate( DisplayInterface & display, bool active )
    {
		// ...
    }

    void onClose( DisplayInterface & display )
    {
        return quit = true;			// returning true indicates that we want the display close to proceed
    }

private:

	Display display;
	bool quit;
};


int main()
{
    Application application;
    application.run();
}

		\endcode

		There can only be a single listener	registered per display object. Once you register a listener, 
		all the default behavior goes away, and you are responsible for handling close requests and
		keyboard and mouse events. For example, if you register a listener but neglect to handle onClose,
		then your user will press Alt-F4 or click on the close button, and nothing will happen!

		\warning Never call Display::open, Display::close or Display::update inside any of these event callbacks!
